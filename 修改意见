施暴者：金昊

Young Woman’s Death in Hebei Sparks Outrage and Renewed Scrutiny of Domestic Violence in China

Suspects, including victim’s husband and mother-in-law, are in custody as the case is transferred for further investigation.

CANGZHOU, Hebei – A suspected case of fatal domestic violence in Hebei province has ignited public fury and drawn attention to the hidden plight of many abuse victims in China, after local police confirmed the death of a 25-year-old woman, allegedly at the hands of her husband.

According to a police statement released by the Mengcun Public Security Bureau on the evening of August 24, authorities received a report on August 22 concerning a criminal incident at a residential community that resulted in the death of the victim, Liu Moumou.

The police subsequently apprehended the primary suspect, Jin Mou, 26, Liu's husband, and Zhang Mou, 48, Jin's mother, who is accused of assisting in destroying or falsifying evidence. Both have been criminally detained.

A forensic examination concluded that Liu died from a craniocerebral injury caused by blunt force. The police statement also explicitly noted that the victim was not pregnant at the time of her death. In a move to ensure a strict and impartial investigation, the Cangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau has ordered the case to be transferred to the Suining County Public Security Bureau for further handling.

The case has shed a harsh light on the isolation faced by some victims. A staff member from the Mengcun County Women's Federation, contacted on August 25, revealed that Liu "had never sought help from us." The staffer added that the federation would typically liaise with police and local township officials to provide support services for women in need, but no such intervention had occurred in this instance.

Heartbreaking details of Liu's life and the lead-up to her death have emerged from interviews with her family and friends, painting a picture of a woman trapped in an abusive marriage.

Liu's aunt, identified as Ms. Liu, told reporters that the family received the devastating news of her niece's death on the morning of August 22. However, elevator surveillance footage from the residential building suggests Jin's family had already rushed Liu to the hospital as early as 5 a.m. that day. Footage from the night of August 21 shows Jin appearing intoxicated, jumping and stumbling unsteadily inside the elevator.

Ms. Liu recounted that the couple were former schoolmates and that Jin had pursued her niece for years, even getting into fights with other suitors. While the family initially opposed the marriage due to Jin's family's poor reputation in the county, they eventually relented.

Tragically, the abuse began almost immediately. "Less than ten days after the wedding, the child was beaten by Jin Mou," Ms. Liu said. She explained that her niece, who had received a generous dowry of several hundred thousand yuan, was a homemaker, while Jin worked as an external staff member at a local procuratorate. After the birth of their child, Liu's focus was entirely on her son.

In the wake of the incident, Jin's father reportedly knelt before Liu's family to apologize. "We now only hope that the murderer will be severely punished," Ms. Liu stated.

A close friend of the victim, Xiaofan (a pseudonym), provided further insight into the controlling and abusive nature of the relationship. She said Liu had even chosen to attend a less prestigious college, the Shijiazhuang Vocational College of Politics and Law, to be with Jin.

"Initially, when he hit her, she would tell her family. Later, she stopped talking about it and kept everything to herself," Xiaofan said. She described a household where Liu was verbally abused for asking for living expenses or for spending what was deemed too much money.

Despite recently securing a part-time job at a steamed bun shop, earning 10 yuan per hour, Liu was forbidden from working by her husband, who allegedly found it "embarrassing."

The case continues to be investigated under the joint efforts of police and women's rights protection departments.


2.女子驾车躲避施暴丈夫致其死亡


案件背景

2025年10月31日，河北省石家庄市中级人民法院二审开庭审理了一起备受社会关注的案件。26岁的曹女士因驾车致其丈夫刘先生死亡，一审被以故意杀人罪判处有期徒刑11年。曹女士及其家属已提出上诉，主张其行为系长期遭受家庭暴力后的正当防卫或紧急避险。


事发经过

根据石家庄市检察院《起诉书》及多方证据，2024年5月21日凌晨，案件经过如下：


- 凌晨1时许，刘先生因怀疑曹女士当晚与女伴王某用餐时有他人参与，在家中与其发生激烈争吵，后持刀要求曹女士一同前往王某住处对质。

- 二人下楼过程中，刘先生在小区内对曹女士进行威胁和殴打。

- 凌晨2时47分，双方驾车抵达王某家附近。下车后争吵持续，刘先生将曹女士拖拽至汽车尾部并撕坏其衣物。

- 凌晨3时09分，曹女士进入驾驶室启动车辆欲自行离开。刘先生见状爬上引擎盖，曹女士加速行驶并甩动车辆，试图将刘先生甩下。

- 凌晨3时10分，车辆在交叉路口与东南角花池发生碰撞。附近人员闻声报警。刘先生送医抢救无效死亡。鉴定显示，其符合较大钝性外力作用致肝、肾、胰腺等多发破裂死亡。


家暴历史与案发细节

曹女士与刘先生于2015年经家人介绍相识。据曹女士父亲回忆，自2021年起，刘先生脾气变得暴躁。2021年8月26日，曹女士曾因被刘先生掌掴导致左耳鼓膜穿孔，家暴行为始为家人知晓。曹女士自述，近两三年来双方频繁争吵，刘先生偶有动手。


案发当晚细节进一步揭示了曹女士所处的危险境遇：

- 刘先生饮酒后回家，质疑曹女士与王某用餐的真实性，随即实施暴力，包括揪头发、拳打背部，并持20厘米切肉刀威胁。

- 在前往王某住处途中，刘先生单手驾车，另一只手持续殴打曹女士，车辆多次闯红灯。

- 曹女士曾趁隙将刀扔出车外，但被刘先生捡回并用刀背击打其肋骨，导致曹女士呕吐物带血丝，后经诊断胰腺撕裂、腹腔内出血。

- 在王某家小区，刘先生变本加厉，将曹女士拖至车尾并扒掉其衣裤，继续脚踹其腹部等多处。


法律程序与争议焦点

公诉机关指控，曹女士明知刘先生趴在引擎盖上仍加速并甩动车辆，意图将其甩下，最终导致刘先生死亡，应以故意杀人罪追究刑责。


一审法院认定曹女士犯故意杀人罪，判处有期徒刑11年。曹女士方面提出上诉，主张其行为是在生命受到现实威胁情况下的自救行为，系正当防卫或紧急避险，不应构成故意杀人罪。


本案二审已开庭审理，法院未当庭宣判。案件进展受到社会广泛关注，尤其聚焦于家庭暴力受害者面临极端情况时的行为边界与法律责任认定。

China Domestic Violence Case: Woman Driving to Escape Abusive Husband Causes His Death

Case Background

On October 31, 2025, the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People's Court in Hebei Province held the second trial of a closely watched case. 26-year-old Ms. Cao was sentenced to 11 years in prison for intentional homicide in the first trial, after causing the death of her husband, Mr. Liu, while driving. Ms. Cao and her family have appealed, claiming her actions constituted justifiable defense or emergency avoidance following prolonged domestic violence.


Incident Details

According to the Shijiazhuang People's Procuratorate's "Indictment" and multiple evidence sources, the incident unfolded as follows on May 21, 2024:


- Around 1:00 AM, Mr. Liu, suspecting Ms. Cao had dined with others besides her female companion Wang that evening, argued fiercely with her at home. He then produced a knife, demanding they go to Wang's residence to confront her.

- While heading downstairs, Mr. Liu threatened and assaulted Ms. Cao within their residential compound.

- At 2:47 AM, they arrived near Wang's home by car. After exiting the vehicle, their argument continued. Mr. Liu dragged Ms. Cao to the rear of the car and tore her clothing.

- At 3:09 AM, Ms. Cao entered the driver's seat and started the car intending to leave. Mr. Liu climbed onto the hood upon seeing this. Ms. Cao accelerated and swerved the vehicle in an attempt to shake him off.

- At 3:10 AM, the vehicle collided with a flower bed at a crossroads. Alerted by the noise, nearby individuals reported the incident. Mr. Liu died after failed medical treatment. Forensic analysis indicated his death resulted from multiple organ ruptures (liver, kidney, pancreas) caused by substantial blunt force.


History of Domestic Violence & Case Specifics

Ms. Cao and Mr. Liu met through family introduction in 2015. According to Ms. Cao's father, Mr. Liu's temper had noticeably deteriorated since 2021. On August 26, 2021, Ms. Cao was diagnosed with a perforated left eardrum after being slapped by Mr. Liu, revealing the domestic abuse to her family. Ms. Cao stated that arguments had become frequent over the past two to three years, with Mr. Liu occasionally becoming physically violent.


Further details from that night highlighted the perilous situation Ms. Cao faced:


- Mr. Liu returned home intoxicated, questioned Ms. Cao about her dinner with Wang, and immediately turned violent—grabbing her hair, punching her back, and threatening her with a 20cm meat cleaver.

- En route to Wang's residence, Mr. Liu drove with one hand while continuously hitting Ms. Cao with the other, running multiple red lights.

- Ms. Cao temporarily threw the knife out of the car, but Mr. Liu retrieved it and struck her ribs with the blunt side, causing her to vomit blood-streaked matter. She was later diagnosed with a pancreatic tear and internal abdominal bleeding.

- Near Wang's compound, Mr. Liu escalated the violence, dragging Ms. Cao to the car's rear, removing her clothes, and kicking her abdomen and other areas.


Legal Proceedings & Controversy

The prosecution accused Ms. Cao of intentional homicide, asserting that she knowingly accelerated and swerved the vehicle while Mr. Liu was on the hood, intending to throw him off, which directly led to his death.


The first-instance court found Ms. Cao guilty of intentional homicide and sentenced her to 11 years imprisonment. Ms. Cao's defense appealed, arguing her actions constituted self-preservation under immediate threat to her life, amounting to justifiable defense or emergency avoidance, and should not be deemed intentional homicide.


The second trial has concluded its court hearing without an immediate verdict. The case has attracted significant public attention, particularly regarding the boundaries of behavior and legal liability for domestic violence victims in extreme situations.


Appendix: Case Timeline

- August 26, 2021: Ms. Cao confirmed to have suffered a perforated eardrum from domestic violence.

Yichang Man Sentenced to Six Months for Street Domestic Violence Causing Wife's Rib Fractures
The Zhijiang People's Court in Hubei Province recently sentenced a man surnamed You to six months in prison for a street domestic violence incident. The assault occurred when the victim, You's wife Wang, refused to let him drive without a license, leading to her sustaining four broken ribs.

The incident took place at a traffic light in Zhijiang City. During a drive home, You became impatient with his wife's driving speed and demanded to take over the wheel. When Wang refused due to his lack of a driver's license, You forcibly dragged her out of the driver's seat, pushed her to the ground, and repeatedly stomped on her left chest and back. The attack resulted in four fractured ribs and soft tissue damage to her right knee. You then abandoned his injured wife at the scene.

Forensic examination confirmed Wang's left chest injuries constituted second-degree minor wounds, with additional minor injuries to her right knee. You surrendered after being contacted by police and confessed to the crime. The court determined his actions constituted intentional injury, considering his confession and compensation payments in the sentencing.

The presiding judge emphasized this case represents typical domestic violence, stating "homes should be warm harbors, no one should commit crimes in the name of family." The judge reminded victims to promptly report abuse, preserve evidence of injuries and medical records, and seek protection through legal channels.

4.中国女留学生新加坡坠亡案

2024年5月23日，新加坡某高档公寓楼下来往的行人发现一具年轻女性的遗体。经确认，死者是20岁的中国留学生李佳轩，来自浙江宁波，就读于新加坡加拿大国际学校。这个本该在6月1日参加毕业典礼的年轻生命，就这样在离毕业仅剩不到十天时戛然而止。

李佳轩出生于宁波一个富裕家庭，从小聪颖伶俐，是亲友眼中的"别人家的孩子"。然而这个看似完美的家庭在2015年遭遇重大变故——李佳轩的母亲因病去世，当时她年仅11岁。母亲的离世成为她人生的重要转折点。

丧偶后，父亲李先生决定将女儿送往新加坡留学。这个决定表面上是为了给女儿提供更好的教育环境，实则让年幼的李佳轩在失去母亲后，又被迫远离故乡，独自在异国他乡生活。

在新加坡加拿大国际学校期间，李佳轩表现出色。她完成了所有IB课程及考试，并陆续向香港、澳门、澳大利亚的多所名校提交了本科入学申请。在老师和同学眼中，她是个成绩优异、积极参与校园活动的模范生。

然而，这个看似光鲜的留学生活背后，隐藏着不为人知的痛苦。据李佳轩的多位好友透露，她长期遭受父亲的家庭暴力。

"她告诉我们，父亲曾用玻璃瓶把她的脑袋砸出血。"李佳轩的好友张薇（化名）回忆道。另一位知情人士补充："李先生酒品不好，喝醉后就会打女儿。但清醒时又很正常，也很舍得为女儿的教育投资。"

这种暴力行为并非偶发。李佳轩的另一位好友徐歌（化名）提供了更为详细的证据："佳轩说，这两年她回国时都会遭受父亲的暴力。今年三月，她父亲来新加坡，在酒店里仍然对她施暴。"

根据徐歌提供的聊天记录，李佳轩详细描述了被父亲"抓着头发往椅子上撞，拿木棍抽打"的经历。令人震惊的是，已经20岁的她甚至还会被父亲打屁股，导致"双腿没有完好的皮肤"。

2024年4月30日，李佳轩在朋友圈分享了一首梁静茹的《暖暖》，配文只有简单的三个字："想妈妈。"这条看似平常的动态引起了朋友们的关注。

"我们察觉不对劲就问她怎么回事。"徐歌说，"她给我们发来语音，语气非常无力。她说心里很绝望，回国面对父亲让她感到恐惧，一想到要回去就想从楼上跳下去。"

在这些最后的语音留言中，李佳轩明确表达了对回家的恐惧和绝望。她说："想到之后要跟父亲待在一起那么久，真的很绝望。"

面对女儿的突然离世，李先生在接受媒体采访时表示，女儿在新加坡学业优秀，即将毕业，原本计划回国等待大学录取结果。对于家暴指控，他仅承认"打过手心"，并称女儿身上的伤痕是"皮肤敏感容易留下淤青"。

李先生强调，今年5月女儿刚完成所有IB课程，并已经获得了多所名校的入学申请资格。他否认女儿有抑郁倾向，对其死亡原因表示困惑。

新加坡警方初步认定李佳轩的死亡属于意外坠楼，但具体原因仍在调查中。这个结论显然无法平息舆论的质疑。

李佳轩的案例引发了广泛的社会讨论。一方面，她是一个成绩优异的留学生，有着光明的前途；另一方面，她又是一个长期遭受家暴的受害者，最终选择在毕业前结束生命。

Chinese Female Student's Fatal Fall in Singapore

On May 23, 2024, pedestrians discovered the body of a young woman at the base of an upscale apartment building in Singapore. The deceased was identified as 20-year-old Chinese international student Li Jiaxuan from Ningbo, Zhejiang province, who attended the Canadian International School Singapore. Her life ended abruptly less than ten days before her scheduled graduation ceremony on June 1.

Li Jiaxuan was born into an affluent Ningbo family, recognized since childhood as exceptionally bright - what Chinese families often call the "model child" among relatives and friends. However, this seemingly perfect family suffered a devastating blow in 2015 when Li's mother passed away from illness, leaving the 11-year-old girl bereft. Her mother's death became a pivotal turning point in her life.

After becoming a widower, her father Mr. Li decided to send his daughter to study in Singapore. While ostensibly providing better educational opportunities, this decision forced the young girl to leave her hometown after losing her mother, confronting life alone in a foreign country.

During her time at the Canadian International School Singapore, Li Jiaxuan excelled academically. She completed all International Baccalaureate (IB) courses and examinations, and had submitted undergraduate applications to numerous prestigious universities in Hong Kong, Macau, and Australia. Teachers and classmates perceived her as an outstanding student who actively participated in campus activities.

Behind this seemingly successful international student facade, however, lay concealed suffering. According to multiple friends of Li Jiaxuan, she endured long-term domestic violence from her father.

"She told us her father once broke a glass bottle over her head, making her bleed," recalled Zhang Wei (pseudonym), a close friend of Li's. Another acquaintance added: "Mr. Li has poor behavior when drinking - he would beat his daughter while drunk. But when sober, he acted normally and generously invested in her education."

The abuse wasn't isolated incidents. Another friend, Xu Ge (pseudonym), provided more detailed evidence: "Jiaxuan said she suffered violence from her father every time she returned to China over the past two years. When her father visited Singapore this March, the abuse continued in their hotel room."

According to chat records provided by Xu Ge, Li Jiaxuan detailed experiences of being "dragged by her hair and smashed against chairs, beaten with wooden sticks." Shockingly, even at 20 years old, she was still subjected to being spanked by her father, resulting in "no intact skin on her legs."

On April 30, 2024, Li Jiaxuan shared the song "Warm" by Fish Leong on her social media, captioned simply: "Missing mom." This seemingly ordinary post alerted her friends.

"We sensed something wrong and asked what was happening," Xu Ge said. "She sent us voice messages, speaking in a very weak tone. She said she felt hopeless inside, that returning to face her father terrified her, and that just thinking about going back made her want to jump from a building."

In these final voice messages, Li Jiaxuan explicitly expressed her fear and despair about returning home. She stated: "Thinking about having to stay with my father for so long afterwards feels truly hopeless."

Following his daughter's sudden death, Mr. Li told media that his daughter had excelled academically in Singapore, was about to graduate, and had planned to return to China awaiting university admission results. Regarding abuse allegations, he only admitted to "occasionally hitting her palms," claiming her bruises resulted from "sensitive skin that marks easily."

Mr. Li emphasized that his daughter had just completed all IB courses in May and had qualified for admission to several prestigious universities. He denied his daughter had depressive tendencies and expressed confusion about her death.

Singapore police preliminarily classified Li Jiaxuan's death as an accidental fall, though specific circumstances remain under investigation. This conclusion has failed to quell public skepticism.

Li Jiaxuan's case has sparked broad social discussion. On one hand, she was an academically outstanding international student with a bright future; on the other, she was a long-term victim of domestic abuse who ultimately chose to end her life just before graduation.

The tragedy highlights several concerning issues: international students' mental health problems often being masked by academic achievement; how domestic violence can persist transnationally in more concealed forms; and how victims' distress signals require more timely responses.

As of May 30, 2024, Mr. Li had not provided detailed responses to the specific abuse allegations raised by his daughter's friends. The questions surrounding this young life continue to await answers.


5.湖南邵阳男子当街强吻、暴力殴打女生

4月8日晚，湖南邵阳市邵阳县发生一起严重的街头暴力事件。一段视频显示，一名男子当街强行搂抱并强吻一名年轻女性，遭到反抗后恼羞成怒，抬脚猛踹，将女孩踹飞倒地，并继续揪扯其头发、实施殴打。整段视频迅速在网络上传播，引发公众极大愤怒与震惊。

然而，事件的舆论焦点在警方通报发布后进一步升级。邵阳县公安局的官方通报称，男子肖某（42岁）与女子张某某（21岁）“因取车问题发生冲突”，“期间肖某将张某某踹倒后，在其耳旁谩骂并多次殴打”。通报中完全未提及“强吻”“性骚扰”等关键信息，仅以“冲突”概括整个过程。这一明显避重就轻的表述被网友批评为“粉饰暴力”“掩盖性侵性质”，在微博上掀起舆论风暴。

据中共官媒后续报道，事发地点位于邵阳县某商场外的咖啡馆门口。当时肖某与朋友聊天时，随意坐在了张某某停放的电动车上。张某某上前取车要求对方离开，双方发生争执。视频中，肖某突然对张某某进行强行拥抱并亲吻，女孩反抗时扯掉其假发，随后肖某暴怒，连续多次踢打并辱骂受害人。目前，警方已对肖某实施刑事拘留。

尽管警方称案件“正在进一步侦办”，但官方通报的语言处理引发了更广泛的社会讨论。大量网友质疑通报“回避性暴力事实”，担心此类“模糊化处理”会进一步削弱对女性安全的保障。一些评论指出：“在公共场合强吻就是性骚扰，暴力行为不该被淡化成‘冲突’。”
另一位网友直言：“连官方都不敢说出‘强吻’两个字，这才是真正让人害怕的地方。”

随着舆论持续发酵，“邵阳县警方通报避重就轻”登上微博热搜，多家媒体发表评论，呼吁以透明、公正的态度面对性别暴力案件，避免以模糊化叙述掩盖受害者的真实遭遇。

Man in Shaoyang, Hunan, Caught on Video Forcibly Kissing and Assaulting a Woman in Public

On the evening of April 8, a serious incident of street violence occurred in Shaoyang County, Hunan Province. A viral video showed a man forcibly grabbing and kissing a young woman in public. When the woman resisted, the man became enraged, kicking her hard enough to send her flying to the ground, then pulling her hair and continuing to beat her. The footage quickly spread across social media, sparking widespread outrage and shock.

The controversy deepened after the local police issued an official statement. According to the Shaoyang County Public Security Bureau, a man surnamed Xiao (42) and a woman surnamed Zhang (21) “had a dispute over a parked electric scooter,” during which “Xiao knocked Zhang to the ground, verbally insulted her near her ear, and struck her multiple times.” The report made no mention of “forcible kissing” or “sexual harassment,” instead describing the incident merely as a “conflict.” This downplaying of events drew fierce criticism online, with netizens accusing the police of “whitewashing violence” and “concealing the sexual nature of the assault,” pushing the topic to the top of Weibo’s trending list.

According to follow-up reports from state media, the incident took place outside a café near a shopping mall in Shaoyang County. Xiao and his friends were chatting while sitting on Zhang’s parked scooter. When Zhang approached to retrieve her vehicle, a dispute ensued. The video shows Xiao suddenly grabbing and kissing Zhang against her will; when she fought back and pulled off his wig, Xiao flew into a rage, repeatedly kicking and verbally abusing her. The suspect has since been placed under criminal detention.

Although police stated that the case is “under further investigation,” the language used in their statement has fueled broader social debate. Many online commenters argued that the report’s omission of key details “erases the sexual violence aspect” and risks undermining women’s safety. One user wrote, “Forcibly kissing someone in public is sexual harassment—violence shouldn’t be watered down as a ‘conflict.’” Another remarked, “What’s truly terrifying is that the official report doesn’t even dare to use the words ‘forcible kiss.’”

As public anger intensified, the hashtag “Shaoyang County Police Downplay Assault” climbed to the top of Weibo’s trending topics. Multiple media outlets have since called for transparency and fairness in handling gender-based violence, urging authorities to avoid obscuring the realities faced by victims through ambiguous official language.


6.Doja Cat‘s mother has alleged the Doja cat’s brother has verbally and physically abused them.

TMZ reported that a temporary restraining order has been filed by the rapper’s mother, Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer, against her son, 30-year-old Raman Dalithando Dlamini. The outlet also reported that this was not the first time the mother has had a restraining order against Raman; it has since expired.

Sawyer accused Raman of physically assaulting Doja Cat (real name Amala Dlamini), including having her “teeth knocked out by Raman”. She also claimed the musician’s brother has given her “cuts and bruises”, along with destroying and stealing some of her property.

Raman was also alleged to verbally abuse his sister “in a very degrading and demeaning manor [sic]”, making Amala feel “unsafe and traumatized.”

It was also claimed by Sawyer that she had been physically abused and threatened multiple times by her son, alleging that the most recent incident occurred “earlier this month”.

According to TMZ, Sawyer has been granted court-ordered protection, and a hearing for a permanent restraining order will soon follow. However, Amala has not been granted protection; the judge explained that the ‘Scarlet’ rapper would need to file her own separate request.

Doja Cat 的母亲声称，这位Doja Cat的哥哥曾对她们实施语言和身体上的虐待。

据 TMZ 报道，Doja Cat 的母亲 Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer 已对她的儿子——30 岁的 Raman Dalithando Dlamini——申请了临时限制令。报道称，这并不是她第一次对 Raman 申请限制令，但之前的那份已过期。

Sawyer 指控 Raman 曾对 Doja Cat（本名 Amala Dlamini）实施过身体攻击，甚至导致她“被 Raman 打掉了牙齿”。她还称，这位音乐人的哥哥曾让她受到了“割伤和瘀伤”，并且破坏、偷走了她的一些财产。

Raman 还被指控以“极其侮辱和贬低的方式”对妹妹进行言语辱骂，使 Amala 感到“没有安全感并受到心理创伤”。

此外，Sawyer 声称她本人也多次遭到儿子的身体攻击和威胁，并表示最近一次事件发生在“本月早些时候”。

据 TMZ 报道，法院已批准 Sawyer 获得法律保护，后续将举行听证会以决定是否发出永久限制令。然而，Amala 尚未获得保护；法官解释称，这位《Scarlet》说唱歌手需要单独提交自己的申请。

7.去年1月，一对华人夫妇的悲剧震惊华人圈。在美国加州圣何塞的一处住宅内，华人女子于某在家中被丈夫陈立人残忍殴打致死。

时隔一年半，该案又有了新进展。在预审现场，多位证人提供了证词，案发当日家中的监控录像也得以公布，情况令人震惊。证词显示，陈某在将妻子殴打致死后，在屋内徘徊几个小时，还拿起了电锯……当地时间6月23日，加州圣克拉拉县法院再次开庭审理此前备受关注的“谷歌工程师杀妻案”。

多名证人和凶嫌陈某本人都出庭，法庭公布了该案包括监控录像在内的更多证据。2024年1月16日，陈某在自己的住房内将妻子殴打致死。据警方记录显示，于某的尸体躺在卧室地板上，头部有严重的钝器击打损伤，房间内的地板、墙上与门上均布满了血迹。而陈某的右臂“极度肿胀和发紫”。其衣服、腿、胳膊和手上都有血迹，胳膊上也有抓痕。

公开资料显示，两人都毕业于清华大学，然后到美国深造。陈某曾在谷歌担任软件工程师，于某也曾在亚马逊、谷歌等顶尖科技公司就职。事发时，两人都是谷歌的员工。两人的房子——也是案发现场，于2023年购买，入住不到一年，花费了大约205万美元。

当天出警的警察Jessica作证称，她在接到报警后约在当天11点多赶到案发现场。Jessica和同事观察了房屋内的情况，发现百叶窗基本是关着的，敲门也没反应。她在后院透过窗户看到陈某“有时双手高举，出神地望着窗外”，且身上有血迹。她表示，随后警方强行进入室内，给陈某戴上手铐，并在屋内进行搜查。在现场，她发现了一个空的行李箱。她还称，在现场听到报警人指责陈某“出轨”了前女友。

报警人也出庭作证，她自称是陈某和于某的大学同学和多年朋友，也住在附近，对这一家的状况很担心，所以向警方报案，申请福利检查（welfare check）。报警人表示，两人的案发当晚，于某提出了离婚的打算。两人的感情已出现裂痕，陈某也曾对报警人的丈夫透露，他犹豫两人要不要离婚。而案发的前一天（1月15日），她和丈夫邀请两人聚会，但两人以陈某“工作压力大，心情不佳”为由拒绝了邀请。她表示，当时陈某“举止奇怪”。她还称，案发前，陈某提到过自己担心被裁员，而且裁员后可能找不到工作。但截至案发时，两人都还是谷歌的员工。

此外，警方公布了一段包含被害人于某生前最后影像记录的监控视频。据称，两人养了猫，监控本用于查看猫的情况，但却成为了此案的重要证据。警探Ronald Miranda称，这些录像以合法方式获得。

1月16日0时21分，于某的身影出现在厨房。


1时04分，厨房的灯灭了。警探Miranda称，此后于某就被丈夫陈某徒手打死。


4时43分，陈某身穿带血的衣服出现。


5时16分，陈某的身影再次出现，右手肿胀，身上有血。


4分钟后，陈某手上拿着电锯出现……监控画面显示，他做出将电锯放在自己脖子上的举动。


8时10分，陈某再次进入厨房，拿出了一把刀刃很宽的刀，放在自己脖子上。


1月16日0时21分，于某的身影出现在厨房。

4分钟后，陈某手上拿着电锯出现……监控画面显示，他做出将电锯放在自己脖子上的举动。


8时10分，陈某再次进入厨房，拿出了一把刀刃很宽的刀，放在自己脖子上。


其门口的监控视频则显示，前一天（1月15日），两人曾爆发过争吵。

据悉，审判还将继续进行。被害者于某的父母也以线上形式参与了庭审。陈某仍然面临谋杀指控，但其辩护律师Wesley Schroeder称，案件审理进入预审环节，表明法庭默认他不认罪。去年，陈某曾多次以身体健康的理由拖延庭审。美国法院的审判效率低下，这样的案件，如果辩方有拖延的意图，可能拖上几年都不会有明确的审判结果，3年算是个常态，5年也不是不可能……


In January last year, a tragic incident involving a Chinese couple shocked the Chinese community. In a residence in San Jose, California, a Chinese woman surnamed Yu was brutally beaten to death by her husband, Chen Liren.


A year and a half later, there has been a new development in the case. During the preliminary hearing, multiple witnesses testified, and surveillance footage from the day of the incident was made public—revealing shocking details. According to testimonies, after Chen beat his wife to death, he wandered around the house for several hours and even picked up a chainsaw…


On June 23, local time, the Santa Clara County Court in California held another hearing for the highly publicized “Google Engineer Wife Murder Case.”


Several witnesses and the suspect Chen himself appeared in court, where more evidence, including surveillance videos, was presented. On January 16, 2024, Chen killed his wife in their home. According to police records, Yu’s body was found lying on the bedroom floor with severe blunt force trauma to the head. The floor, walls, and door of the room were covered in blood. Chen’s right arm was described as “extremely swollen and purple,” with blood on his clothes, legs, arms, and hands, and scratches on his arms.


Public records show that both Chen and Yu graduated from Tsinghua University before continuing their studies in the United States. Chen worked as a software engineer at Google, while Yu had previously worked at top tech companies including Amazon and Google. At the time of the incident, both were employed by Google. The house where the incident occurred was purchased in 2023 for about $2.05 million, and they had lived there for less than a year.


Jessica, one of the police officers who responded to the scene, testified that she arrived around 11 a.m. after receiving the call. Jessica and her colleagues observed that most of the blinds were closed and received no response after knocking. Through the backyard window, she saw Chen “sometimes raising his hands and staring blankly outside,” with blood visible on his body. She stated that the police then forced entry, handcuffed Chen, and conducted a search. At the scene, they found an empty suitcase. Jessica also said she heard the caller accuse Chen of “cheating” with an ex-girlfriend.


The caller also testified in court, identifying herself as a college classmate and long-time friend of both Chen and Yu who lived nearby. She said she had been concerned about the couple’s situation and therefore called the police to request a welfare check. The caller stated that on the night of the incident, Yu had expressed her intention to divorce. Their relationship had deteriorated, and Chen had previously told the caller’s husband that he was unsure whether to proceed with the divorce. On the day before the incident (January 15), the caller and her husband had invited the couple to a gathering, but they declined, saying Chen was “under work pressure and in a bad mood.” She recalled that Chen’s behavior seemed “strange.” She also mentioned that before the incident, Chen had expressed concerns about potential layoffs and the difficulty of finding another job. However, both were still employed at Google at the time.


Additionally, the police released surveillance footage showing Yu’s final moments before her death. The couple had cats, and the cameras were originally installed to monitor them—but the footage became crucial evidence in the case. Detective Ronald Miranda testified that the videos were obtained legally. At 12:21 a.m. on January 16, Yu appeared in the kitchen.


At 1:04 a.m., the kitchen lights went out. Detective Miranda stated that Yu was killed by Chen’s bare hands afterward.


At 4:43 a.m., Chen appeared wearing blood-stained clothing.


At 5:16 a.m., he appeared again, his right hand swollen and covered in blood.


Four minutes later, Chen appeared holding a chainsaw… Surveillance footage showed him putting the chainsaw near his own neck.


At 8:10 a.m., Chen entered the kitchen again and took out a large-bladed knife, placing it against his neck.


At 12:21 a.m. on January 16, Yu appeared in the kitchen.


At 1:04 a.m., the kitchen lights went out. Detective Miranda stated that Yu was killed by Chen’s bare hands afterward.


At 4:43 a.m., Chen appeared wearing blood-stained clothing.


At 5:16 a.m., he appeared again, his right hand swollen and covered in blood.


Four minutes later, Chen appeared holding a chainsaw… Surveillance footage showed him putting the chainsaw near his own neck.


At 8:10 a.m., Chen entered the kitchen again and took out a large-bladed knife, placing it against his neck.


Footage from the doorway camera showed that the day before (January 15), the couple had a heated argument.


It is reported that the trial will continue. The victim Yu’s parents also attended the hearing online. Chen still faces a murder charge, but his defense attorney, Wesley Schroeder, stated that the case has now entered the preliminary hearing phase, which implies that the court presumes a plea of not guilty. Last year, Chen delayed multiple hearings by citing health issues. Given the inefficiency of the U.S. court system, if the defense intends to prolong the case, it may take several years before a verdict is reached—three years would be typical, and five years would not be impossible.


8.7月14日，北京女生小玲（化名）向记者讲述了她“花轿变轮椅”的故事——2023年，同居男友杨某看似意外的动手，导致其左右手不同程度受伤，生活自理不便。2024年，因她想做手部手术尽快恢复，致两人爆发争吵进而动手。小玲至今记得对方动手时曾说：“残了就只能跟着我”。


这次，小玲前去北京海淀香山派出所报警。立案后，案件卡在伤情鉴定近10个月。而此事在被披露后，也受到了全网关注。近日，记者与小玲进行了深度采访，了解事件前前后后的细节。与此同时，7月17日下午，记者联系了香山派出所。接线民警回应，流程没有问题。朋友聚会相识交往同居期间男方两次动手。


2022年底，在一次朋友聚会中，小玲结识了自称“在北京开公司”的杨某。很快，杨某对小玲展开追求：不怕传染病前来照顾她、24小时视频报备、每天嘘寒问暖。“我以为遇到真心人，2023年2月确定关系后，很快就同意让他退了租住的房子，搬进我名下北京的房子。”


然而，甜蜜只维持了数月。2023年7月，小玲无意中从杨某朋友处了解到，杨某可能曾有“侵犯公民个人信息罪”的案底。为进一步了解情况，小玲想要查看他的手机，但在争执中杨某为了抢手机，弄伤了小玲的双手。


医院门诊病历诊断：神经痛、复杂区域疼痛综合征、肢体肿胀、疑似淋巴回流障碍。近一年后另一份诊断报告则显示：左侧尺骨潜入综合征、三角纤维软骨中央盘穿孔、三角韧带浅层信号增高、左腕关节滑膜增生、掌侧软组织水肿、尺侧皮下软组织水肿、旋前圆肌水肿等结果。“我一直认为这次可能是双方争吵中，他不小心导致的。”杨某道歉并写下保证书，还承诺承担医药费并给予照顾，小玲暂时生活无法自理，最终同意和好。他很会做人，常买烟买酒去我爸妈家，还会抢着做饭，所以即便生活中有一些摩擦，我仍觉得人性本善。”


小玲依然和杨某同居生活。自2024年4月起，杨某频繁提出领证，并安排6月拍摄“花轿”主题婚纱照，要求未来小玲把现有房产加他名字。“他说以后若再买房要写他儿子的名字，在交往前我也根本不知道他有儿子。”小玲回忆说。2024年7月7日，双方又因小玲手部是否要做手术起了冲突，杨某再次动手，致她髋臼盂唇损伤。“他边打边说‘残了就只能跟着我’。”因再次受伤，站立行走都会疼痛，小玲当前只能靠轮椅出行，生活完全依赖年近七旬的父母。


自己要做手部手术为啥会产生那么大的冲突？在小玲看来，受伤后自己一直请病假，后续又失去工作，因此社保中断。“手术费无法医保报销，大约需要10万元。”小玲认为，她的手是杨某弄伤的，就需要他来负责。第二次受伤后，杨某还与其生活在一起。小玲担心提分手对方还会动手，就在一次杨某出门后，将其物品放置门口，并更换了门锁。“这样就分手，也没有住在一起了。”


2024年9月，小玲前往派出所报警。家庭纠纷和家庭暴力如何判定？根据小玲提供的北京市公安局海淀分局行政案件立案告知书，2024年9月18日，小玲报称的其被故意伤害一案已立案。


On July 14, Beijing woman Xiao Ling (a pseudonym) shared her story with reporters about how her life went from a “wedding sedan to a wheelchair.” In 2023, her cohabiting boyfriend, Yang, seemingly accidentally became violent, resulting in injuries to both of her hands, leaving her unable to live independently. In 2024, a dispute over her desire to undergo hand surgery led to another violent incident. Xiao Ling still remembers that during the altercation, Yang said, “If you’re disabled, you’ll have to follow me.”


This time, Xiao Ling reported the incident to the Xiangshan Police Station in Haidian, Beijing. After the case was filed, it got stuck in the injury assessment process for nearly 10 months. After the story was exposed, it received widespread attention online. Recently, a reporter conducted an in-depth interview with Xiao Ling to understand the details of the case. On the afternoon of July 17, the reporter contacted the Xiangshan Police Station, where an officer responded that there were no issues with the procedural process. Xiao Ling and Yang first met at a friend’s gathering, and during their cohabitation, Yang became violent on two occasions.


At the end of 2022, Xiao Ling met Yang, who claimed to own a company in Beijing, at a friend’s gathering. Soon after, Yang began courting her, offering to care for her despite the risk of infectious diseases, maintaining 24-hour video calls, and showing daily concern for her. “I thought I had met someone sincere. After confirming the relationship in February 2023, I agreed to let him cancel his rented place and move into my Beijing apartment.”


However, the sweetness didn’t last long. In July 2023, Xiao Ling accidentally learned from one of Yang’s friends that Yang might have a criminal record for “violating personal information.” To investigate further, Xiao Ling wanted to check his phone, but during the argument, Yang tried to snatch the phone, injuring both of Xiao Ling’s hands.


The medical diagnosis stated: nerve pain, complex regional pain syndrome, limb swelling, and suspected lymphatic reflux disorder. Another diagnosis report, nearly a year later, showed: left ulnar tunnel syndrome, triangular fibrocartilage complex perforation, increased signal of the triangular ligament, synovial hyperplasia of the left wrist joint, palmar soft tissue edema, ulnar subcutaneous soft tissue edema, and pronator teres muscle edema, among other results. “I always thought it was just an accident during an argument,” Xiao Ling said. Yang apologized, wrote a letter of guarantee, promised to cover medical expenses, and take care of her. Xiao Ling, unable to care for herself, eventually agreed to reconcile. “He was good at handling people—he would buy cigarettes and alcohol for my parents and even cook for us. So even though there were some issues, I still thought that people were inherently good.”


Xiao Ling continued living with Yang. Since April 2024, Yang frequently proposed getting married, even planning to take “wedding sedan” themed photos in June and asking Xiao Ling to add his name to the title of her current property. “He said that if we bought a house in the future, we would have to put his son’s name on the title. Before we got together, I didn’t even know he had a son,” Xiao Ling recalled. On July 7, 2024, they had another argument over whether Xiao Ling should undergo surgery for her hands, and Yang became violent again, injuring her acetabular labrum. “He hit me while saying, ‘If you’re disabled, you’ll have to follow me.’” After the second injury, Xiao Ling experienced pain even while standing and walking, and now relies on a wheelchair for mobility, completely dependent on her nearly seventy-year-old parents.


Why did her desire for hand surgery lead to such a serious conflict? Xiao Ling believes that after the injury, she took sick leave and later lost her job, resulting in a break in her social insurance. “The surgery is not covered by insurance, and will cost about 100,000 yuan.” Xiao Ling felt that since Yang had caused the injury to her hands, he should take responsibility. After the second injury, Yang continued living with her. Xiao Ling was afraid that if she broke up with him, he would get violent again. So, after Yang went out one day, she placed his belongings at the door and changed the locks. “That way, we broke up, and I no longer lived with him.”

In September 2024, Xiao Ling went to the police station to report the incident. How are family disputes and domestic violence determined? According to the Administrative Case Filing Notice from the Haidian Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau provided by Xiao Ling, the case of intentional harm she reported was officially filed on September 18, 2024.

9.近日，来自黑龙江的于女士在社交平台求助称，她43岁的母亲张某萍在辽宁营口遭前夫张某铭殴打，导致肠破裂、混合型休克被送到了重症监护室，至今还没有脱离生命危险。

9月5日，记者联系到于女士。她介绍，母亲是黑龙江人，父亲和母亲于2015年离异。2017年，母亲张某萍嫁给了辽宁营口盖州市卧龙泉镇娘娘庙村的张某铭，两人育有一女，今年8岁。

婚姻存续期间，张某铭多次殴打张某萍，虽然于女士多次阻拦，甚至报警处理，但张某铭仍肆无忌惮，连妹妹也告诉于女士她曾被生父张某铭打骂。2025年2月17日两人终于离婚。于女士说，今年3月初，母亲便带着妹妹到天津找她。上月，因临近开学，妹妹转学的问题未得到解决，张某萍只好带着小女儿回到了卧龙泉镇。

8月29日17时左右，她收到了母亲张某萍的前夫张某铭使用她微信发来的消息，称她母亲腹泻、吃不下饭、站也站不稳，“走路都费劲”，让于女士有时间来看看。18时许，张某铭再次通过微信发来一段视频，其中显示张某萍躺在病床上，已经失去了意识，张某铭在视频中说：“你妈现在不行了，昏迷了，就一口气，现在就上医院。”

事发突然，于女士想到立即报警，却先接到了母亲居住的卧龙泉镇警察的来电，对方称她母亲由于病情严重，即将转院到辽宁省营口市中心医院，让她尽快赶到。8月30日凌晨3时左右，于女士在营口市中心医院急诊科见到了母亲的前夫张某铭，此时母亲正在重症监护室抢救，民警现场了解情况后，便将张某铭带走进行调查。

据于女士提供的立案告知书显示，经审查，张某萍被故意伤害案一案有犯罪事实，根据《中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法》第一百一十二条之规定，决定立案案件编号侦查，盖章单位为盖州市公安局，时间为8月30日。

据营口市中心医院医务部9月3日出具的病情介绍显示，目前诊断为：直肠破裂，腹盆腔积液积气、混合型休克等，患者目前病情危急。另据CT检查报告单显示，她母亲被诊断为：右侧脑外间隙增宽。 双侧眶内壁异常改变。

于女士说，9月3日医生表示，她母亲情况危急，随时有生命危险。9月5日，记者联系到卧龙泉镇派出所，一名工作人员表示，张某铭目前已被刑事拘留，由于他不是办案民警，具体案件他并不清楚，后续待法院进行审理。

Recently, Ms. Yu from Heilongjiang reached out for help on social media, stating that her 43-year-old mother, Zhang Xiaoping, was beaten by her ex-husband Zhang Xiaoming in Yingkou, Liaoning, leading to a ruptured intestine and mixed shock. She was sent to the intensive care unit and has not yet been out of life-threatening danger.

On September 5, a reporter contacted Ms. Yu. She explained that her mother is from Heilongjiang, and her parents divorced in 2015. In 2017, her mother remarried Zhang Xiaoming, from Nian Niang Miao Village in Wolongquan Town, Gai County, Yingkou, Liaoning. They have a daughter together, who is 8 years old this year.

During their marriage, Zhang Xiaoming repeatedly abused Zhang Xiaoping. Although Ms. Yu tried to intervene and even called the police several times, Zhang Xiaoming was still unrestrained. Even Ms. Yu’s younger sister reported that she had been verbally and physically abused by their biological father, Zhang Xiaoming. The couple finally divorced on February 17, 2025. Ms. Yu said that in early March this year, her mother brought her younger sister to Tianjin to visit her. However, due to unresolved issues with her sister’s school transfer, Zhang Xiaoping had to return to Wolongquan Town with her daughter at the end of August.

Around 5 PM on August 29, Ms. Yu received a message sent via her mother's WeChat by her ex-husband, Zhang Xiaoming, saying that her mother had diarrhea, couldn’t eat, and was unstable on her feet. "She can hardly walk," the message said, asking Ms. Yu to come if possible. At around 6 PM, Zhang Xiaoming sent another video, showing Zhang Xiaoping lying in bed, unconscious. In the video, Zhang Xiaoming said, "Your mother is not doing well now, she’s unconscious, just a breath, I’m taking her to the hospital now."

The situation happened suddenly, and while Ms. Yu thought about calling the police immediately, she first received a call from the police in Wolongquan Town where her mother lived. The police informed her that due to her mother’s severe condition, she was about to be transferred to the Yingkou City Central Hospital and asked Ms. Yu to hurry. Around 3 AM on August 30, Ms. Yu arrived at the emergency department of Yingkou City Central Hospital, where she met her mother’s ex-husband, Zhang Xiaoming. Her mother was in the ICU for emergency treatment. After the police investigated the situation, Zhang Xiaoming was taken into custody for questioning.

According to the case filing notice provided by Ms. Yu, an investigation into the case of intentional harm to Zhang Xiaoping was officially filed after a review, with criminal facts confirmed. According to Article 112 of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China, the case was filed for investigation under the case number issued by the Gai County Public Security Bureau, with the official date of filing being August 30.

According to the medical report from the Yingkou City Central Hospital's Medical Department issued on September 3, the diagnosis is: ruptured rectum, pelvic and abdominal fluid and gas accumulation, mixed shock, etc. The patient is in critical condition. Additionally, a CT scan report showed: widened right parenchymal space, abnormal changes in both orbital inner walls.

Ms. Yu said that on September 3, the doctor indicated that her mother’s condition was critical and she was at risk of dying at any time. On September 5, the reporter contacted the Wolongquan Town Police Station. A staff member stated that Zhang Xiaoming has been criminally detained. However, as he was not involved in the case, he was not aware of the specific details, and the case would be further reviewed in court.

10.2年被家暴16次女子获分144万元，当事人：我要的从来不是钱，而是一个交代

10月24日，记者从当事人小谢处获悉，被家暴16次女子财产纠纷案宣判。小谢告诉记者，此次判决共计获得约144万元。“这个数字在很多人眼里或许是一笔不小的财富，但对我而言就像是一道结了痂又被撕开的伤口。有人说打官司是为了钱，但我宁愿没有这笔钱，也不想经历那一段需要补偿的过去。我要的从来都不是钱，而是一个交代。而且到现在我也没收到过孩子的抚养费。”

据公开报道，小谢来自四川成都，她和贺某相识于网络。在贺某的追求下，两人于2020年7月确立了恋爱关系，并在2021年5月20日结婚，婚后育有一女。贺某平时经营一家广告公司和一家建筑公司，和前妻还有一个儿子。

小谢称结婚两年里，自己被丈夫贺某家暴了16次，最后一次被家暴导致其肠破裂需要终身佩戴粪袋。其间她报警6次，警方两次出具家庭暴力告诫书。她曾向6个部门寻求过帮助，也去法院提交了离婚诉讼书并申请了人身保护令，但这些都没有让贺某收敛，反而变本加厉地对其实施暴力。

2023年1到4月，在婚姻存续期间，贺某在小谢不知情的情况下，将夫妻共同存款91.29万元出借给四川某贸易公司。而该公司法人代表为杨某，即贺某的母亲。小谢认为，贺某在自己不知情的情况下，将夫妻共同存款出借，这是其在婚内恶意转移财产，应当立即归还，于是起诉进行维权。

A woman who was abused 16 times was awarded 1.44 million yuan in a property dispute case; says: "What I wanted was never money, but an explanation."

On October 24, the reporter learned from the involved party, Xiao Xie, that the property dispute case involving a woman who had been abused 16 times had been judged. Xiao Xie told the reporter that she was awarded approximately 1.44 million yuan in this ruling. "This amount may seem like a considerable fortune to many, but to me, it feels like a wound that had scabbed over and was ripped open again. Some people say that lawsuits are about money, but I would rather not have this money and never have to go through that period that requires compensation. What I wanted was never money, but an explanation. And even now, I haven’t received any child support."

According to public reports, Xiao Xie is from Chengdu, Sichuan. She met He, her husband, online. Under He’s pursuit, they began a romantic relationship in July 2020 and got married on May 20, 2021. They have a daughter together. He runs an advertising company and a construction company and has a son from his previous marriage.

Xiao Xie stated that during their two years of marriage, she was subjected to domestic violence 16 times by her husband, He. The last incident of abuse resulted in a ruptured intestine, leaving her needing to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of her life. During this time, she called the police six times, and the police issued two domestic violence warnings. She sought help from six different departments and even filed for divorce in court and applied for a personal protection order, but none of these measures stopped him. Instead, he escalated his violent behavior.

From January to April 2023, while they were still married, He secretly lent out 912,900 yuan of their joint savings to a trading company in Sichuan. The legal representative of the company was Yang, He’s mother. Xiao Xie believed that he had maliciously transferred the couple's joint assets without her knowledge and should immediately return the funds. She thus filed a lawsuit to protect her rights.

如何帮助身边的家暴受害者


A little help can go a long way.

The experience of surviving relationship abuse is traumatic, and people in any stage of an abusive relationship should be able to depend on others for support as they process complex emotions and navigate next steps.

You can provide essential emotional support by:

Acknowledging that their situation is difficult, scary, and brave of them to regain control from.
Not judging their decisions and refusing to criticize them or guilt them over a choice they make.
Remembering that you cannot “rescue them,” and that decisions about their lives are up to them to make.
Not speaking poorly of the abusive partner.
Helping them create a safety plan.
Continuing to be supportive of them if they do end the relationship and are understandably lonely, upset, or return to their abusive partner.
Offering to go with them to any service provider or legal setting for moral support.
Depending on the situation, a survivor may be financially dependent on an abusive partner or otherwise lacking access to material resources. One of the most immediate ways you can support someone experiencing relationship abuse is by helping them with their material needs.

Help them identify a support network to assist with physical needs like housing, food, healthcare, and mobility as applicable.
Help them by storing important documents or a “to-go bag” in case of an emergency situation.
Encourage them to participate in activities outside of their relationship with friends and family, and be there to support them in such a capacity
Encourage them to talk to people who can provide further help and guidance, like The Hotline or our teen and young adult project love is respect.
If they give you permission, help document instances of domestic violence in their life, including pictures of injuries, exact transcripts of interactions, and notes on a calendar of dates that incidents of abuse occur.
Don’t post information about them on social media that could be used to identify them or where they spend time.
Help them learn about their formal legal rights through resources like Women’s Law, which provides information on domestic violence laws and procedures.
With their permission, ensure that others in the buildings where the survivor lives and works are aware of the situation, including what to do (and what not to do) during a moment of crisis or confrontation with an abusive partner.
These examples are by no means comprehensive but provide an understanding of ways to support a survivor that can help protect their safety.



国外成功的保护措施

日本：

主要立法与制度：Act on the Prevention of Spousal Violence and the Protection of Victims（2001年颁布）是日本应对配偶暴力（包括家庭暴力的一部分）的主要法律，规定政府与地方自治体必须“努力”进行宣传、研究、支持受害者、更生加害者等。

https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3151/je?utm_source=chatgpt.com

日本政府于 2023 年修订该法，将保护范围扩大到“严重的精神的／心理的伤害”并延长保护令期限等。https://metropolisjapan.com/domestic-violence-in-japan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

日本还设有全国性的热线（如 DV相談プラス），提供多语言网上聊天、电话服务，涵盖英文、中文、韩语等https://findahelpline.com/organizations/dv-domestic-violence-hotline-plus?utm_source=chatgpt.com

地方政府与警察、社会支援机构协作（例如：咨询支援机构 +庇护 +法律援助）形成“受害者支援网络”。例如：在日本各地“配偶者暴力相談支援センター”负责咨询／保护／临时救助。https://wabisabi.media/english/blog/what-to-do-when-being-a-victim-of-family-violence-in-japan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

有外籍配偶在日本遭受家庭暴力，通过支援中心获得庇护、法律咨询、住所变更，从而重新开始生活。相关支援机构可提供从“逃离”“安置”“法律诉讼”到“生活自立支援”的一条龙服务。https://tokyo.philembassy.net/consular-section/services/atn-corner/domestic-violence/?utm_source=chatgpt.com


韩国：

韩国有 Act on Prevention of Domestic Violence and Protection, etc. of Victims 及相关法律体系，规定当警察接到家庭暴力报告时，应立即介入、隔离施暴者、收集证据、转介受害者至庇护／治疗等。https://seoullawgroup.com/domestic-crimes-in-korea-how-to-get-help/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

韩国政府设有多语热线、对外籍受害者开放服务。https://seoullawgroup.com/domestic-violence-korea/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

2003年韩国发生严重性暴力案件后，政府建立了 “Sunflower Centre” 综合支援中心，整合医疗、法律、心理支援，为性／家庭暴力受害者提供一站式服务。

快速介入机制：如警察接报后可以立即将施暴者和受害者隔离。

DV有可能改变吗？

1.家暴是有迹可循的

家暴行为是一种童年习得.

大部分家暴和被家暴者，往往有不幸的童年.

他们在小时候经常看见养育者打架，或者经常被养育者打。

父母是孩子最好的老师，孩子会害怕，会想反抗和改变，但因为年纪和身体原因没有反抗和改变的能力，长期下来，遇到冲突实施暴力这种意识，就在潜意识层面驻扎了下来。

(这里的冲突包括现实层面的冲突和内心的动力冲突)


这种意识，会形成念到1后面就是2的条件反射，当外界某个相似的情景一出现，他们就会很自然地依照条件反射把2做出来。



2.长大后变成自己讨厌的人

在童年处于被害者身份时，

人都会觉得这种暴力行为是不对的，

因为它给自己带来了痛苦，于是很讨厌。


但在成年后，

这种驻扎在潜意识层面的条件反射会不断被激发，不断影响一个人的思维模式，稍不注意就会形成强迫性重复。


如果伴侣弱势，他们就会强势地成为主动攻击者，如果伴侣强势，他们就会充当受害者，

这种关系模式，要么存在于两个都有这种意识的人身上，要么把一个没有这种意识的人，改造成接受这种意识的人。


3.觉知能力的获得是改变家暴的前提

觉知，就是察觉和知道。任何改变的第一步都是知道不对，只有家暴者知道家暴行为是不对的，

深刻认识到它会给伴侣造成严重的身体和精神伤害， TA才会去改变。


很多人失去了正常的觉知能力，

是因为他们的这种能力从小就被压制和剥夺了，小时候在表达感觉时经常被否定，会造成心理上的习得性无助，

然后升级为对自己感觉的不信任，甚至直接忽视。


当对自己的感觉都忽视掉了，

也就没办法察觉和照顾伴侣的感受了，

于是，当启动按钮被按下，家暴程序就自动运转了。


4.正确的归因能力是改变家暴的基础

正确的归因能力，就是从客观的角度去分析问题，该向内归因就向内归因，该向外归因就向外归因，只有归因正确，才能把问题解决。


很多人没有正确的归因能力，是因为他们

一遇到问题首先就推卸责任，认为自己一点问题都没有。


这种归因能力，需要通过不断思考来形成和巩固，它不仅是改变家暴的基础，我认为，它是获得幸福生活和事业成就的基础，

可惜的是，很多人在快节奏的生活和巨大的社会压力下，已经失去了这个能力。


5.如果没有办法改变就只能离开了

改变只能由内发生，

如果当事人没有觉知，改变就不会发生。


之前我说过，家暴这种关系模式，

要么存在于两个都有这种意识的人身上，

要么把一个没有这种意识的人，改造成接受这种意识的人。这种关系模式，不仅存在于伴侣关系，

如果以后有了小孩，大概率上，那个小孩也会继续习得并投射这种模式，然后形成一个恶性的家族循环。好好想一下，你愿意成为这种恶性家族循环的一份子吗?


最后，我还是希望家暴者能够认识到自己的问题，

慢慢改变自己的思维模式，把那些动物性的条件反射摒弃掉，把更好的爱带给伴侣。

DV相关常见Q及其A

1.如果想帮助家暴者改变，并带TA去看心理医生，这样能解决问题吗？


除非他自己想改变，不然帮助改变这个想法会被他认为是侮辱，谁都不想听到自己有问题这样的话，成年人被带着去看心理医生这件事，听着就让人感觉很不舒服，但问题又存在，关键还是看他愿意沟通不，还有一个问题，力是相互的，一件事情发展到最终阶段，一般来讲双方都有自己没意识到的失误。
